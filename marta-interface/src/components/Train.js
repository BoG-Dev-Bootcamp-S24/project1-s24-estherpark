//In this file you can create the design for an exportable Train component that takes in the data for one train and returns the display for it.
//To display whether or not a train is On Time or Delayed check if DELAY === "T0S"
//(if the equality is true, it is on time, and if not, we consider it delayed).
//Display each of the train components for the specified line (first make sure to import the Train component into the file).
//Hint: You do not need to display each component manually as the number of trains in a line or subject to change.
//Instead you can use the map and spread functions you learned in Exercise 4 to take in the props at each index and display a component for each train's props.
